# Monorepo layout

This is a **pnpm workspace** monorepo. Recipes are organized **by product → language →
flavor → recipe**:

```
recipes/<product>/<language>/{sdk,native}/<recipe-name>/
```

```

## Why this shape

- **Product first** reads naturally for a product-led company — a user lands on "audio"
  then picks their language.
- **Flavor as a folder** (`sdk` / `native`) makes the two implementation styles first-class
  and orthogonal to the recipe name. No `-rest` suffix to remember.
- **Self-contained recipes**: each leaf folder has its own manifest, `.env.example`, and
  `README.md` so it can be copied out and run alone.

## Products

| Folder   | What                                        | Status                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `audio/` | Text-to-Speech, plus future audio products. | Active. TypeScript + Python on v4 SDKs. |

## Languages and tooling

| Language      | Manager  | Workspace member?                           | Notes                                                                                  |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript/JS | **pnpm** | Yes — matched by `recipes/*/typescript/*/*` | Run with `tsx`. Versions come from the `catalog:` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.            |
| Python        | **uv**   | No (managed per-recipe)                     | Each recipe has its own `pyproject.toml`; run with `uv run`.                           |
| Bash          | —        | No (curl scripts)                           | Native flavor only. Each recipe is a `.sh` (curl + jq) you can copy-paste. `chmod +x`. |

## Naming rules

- Folders are **kebab-case**: `audio`, `streaming-to-file`.
- Language folders are exactly `typescript`, `python`, or `bash`.
- Flavor folders are exactly `sdk` or `native`.
- Recipe names describe the task, not the API method: `quickstart`, `streaming-to-file`,
  `clone-a-voice`, `phone-call-agent`. No `-rest` / `-sdk` suffix — the parent folder
  encodes the flavor.
- Empty leaf folders (a language with no recipes yet) carry a `.gitkeep` so the namespace
  stays visible.

## Workspace mechanics

- `pnpm install` at the root installs all TypeScript recipes.
- Shared dependency versions live in the **catalog** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). Recipes
  reference them as `"@speechify/api": "catalog:"`.
- `pnpm -r <script>` runs a script across every JS recipe; `pnpm --filter <name> <script>`
  targets one.
- Python recipes are intentionally **outside** the pnpm workspace — see
  [`python-recipes.md`](./python-recipes.md).
